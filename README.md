# React Native FlatList/SectionList Items Not Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where FlatList or SectionList components render, but the items within the list fail to appear.  The issue is often related to data fetching and the structure of the data provided to the list component. This repository provides example code illustrating the problem and its solution.

## Bug Description
The `BugFlatList.js` file contains a FlatList that attempts to render data from a remote source.  Due to an intentional error in the data handling, the list renders an empty view, despite the data being fetched successfully.  The solution demonstrates how to fix this. 

## Solution
The `SolutionFlatList.js` file demonstrates the corrected version of the FlatList, including the necessary steps to properly display the data.
